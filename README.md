# Employee Salary Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict employee salaries based on experience, education, job title, and industry.

## Objective

To help HR professionals make data-based salary decisions by using a predictive model.

## Files Included

- `salary_prediction.py`: Python script for model training
- `employee_data.csv`: Sample dataset
- `salary_model.pkl`: Trained model file
- `README.md`: Project guide

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python salary_prediction.py
   ```

## Output

- Model evaluation (MSE, RÂ²)
- Scatter plot of predicted vs actual salaries

## Future Scope

- Add more features (location, company size)
- Streamlit or Flask deployment
- Use advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

## References

- Scikit-learn documentation
- Kaggle datasets
